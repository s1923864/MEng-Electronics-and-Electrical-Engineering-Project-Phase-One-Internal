Prof Tharm. Ratnarajah (IDCOM)
TR - Cell-search and interference cancellation in 5G cellular networks
Keywords or subject area: wireless communications, signal processing.

The main aim of the project is to learn and understand the concepts and procedures of 5G cell
searching, to be able to see how it works by simulating it on MATLAB and implementing noise and
interference within the system to study their effects on cell searching. Cell searching is the initial
procedure for when a user equipment (UE), such as mobile phones, begin to link up with a base station
(BS). The problem that we face, is being able to detect the correct base station through all the noise
and interference, and more importantly, finding the cell ID of a weak BS signal that is being overshadowed by a stronger BS signal, useful for performing handovers with other cells. Student is expect to
implement this cell search algorithm on the USRP platform.
